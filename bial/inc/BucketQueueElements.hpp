 * @version 1.0.00
 * @brief
 * Content: Bucket-sort queue class 
 * <br> Description: A bucket-sort queue. It is useful to sort a large set
 * of elements whose weight domain is not very large,
 * e.g. IFT and OPF algorithms over MR images. 
 * <br> Future add-on's: Deal with negative values. 
 *                  Add fast operation functions in which queue does not grow. 
 * Warning: In Boost library, there is a class named circular_buffer
 * that may do exactly the same as Vector< WeightNode >.
